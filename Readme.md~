This is a set of demo software for the L3D cube.  There are two types of programs in this repository:  Native programs,
that run on the [spark processor](https://www.spark.io/) in the cube, and don't require a wifi connection to work,
and Streaming programs, that stream data to the cube from a computer or phone over wifi.

For streaming programs, you'll need to load the Listener program(located in the /Streaming directory) onto the Spark, 
and then run the program on your computer that generates the pattern for the cube.  Data is streamed via UDP multicast on port 
6000, which most home routers support.  If you're not seeing any data come through, it's possible that your router is blocking
multicast packets.  If you can fiddle with the router's settings, check to see if it's blocking packets on port 6000, and if 
it's disabling multicast.  
If you have a network that requires you to click through a form to get access to the web, the processor in the cube
